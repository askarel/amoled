This is a script for updating LED signs made by amplus.

It is based on the toledo.py script written by Christian Sullivan (hanzo@freezerpants.com)
A copy of his script is included in the directory toledo, but you can download his latest version
at his website: http://freezerpants.com/toledo

WHY REWRITING HIS PROGRAM ?

The original script has a heavy dependency for embedded devices like the WRT54GL: python.
By rewriting his script as a shell script, i can abuse the busybox shell with no external dependency,
while keeping a small footprint.

At the moment it is unusable, but the logic is being built.

Stay tuned...

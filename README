This is a script for updating LED signs made by amplus.

It is based on the toledo.py script written by Christian Sullivan (hanzo@freezerpants.com)
A copy of his script is included in the directory toledo, but you can download his latest version
at his website: http://freezerpants.com/toledo

WHY REWRITING HIS PROGRAM ?

The original script has a heavy dependency for embedded devices like the WRT54GL: python.
By rewriting his script as a shell script, i can abuse the busybox shell with no external dependency,
while keeping a small footprint.

MISSING FEATURES
- The pages can have custom graphics. You need to build them by hand
- The sign support several text colours on the same page. The script do not allow that at the moment.
- You can embed the current date and the current time within your text. Supported by the sign, not by the script.
- Some page features are not coded in the script yet.
- The sign has several fonts available. The script only use the default one. Support for multiple fonts on the
    same page need to be investigated.
- Page play schedule
- Deleting one page or one schedule is not supported yet. However, Resetting the sign is.

PLEASE NOTE: This is my first script using getopts. It is very messy ant the command line arguments
will change without warning.

The script come with one application: mpcled.sh. This script will update your LED sign with the current track
being played using the informations provided by mpd.

BUGS
    There are plenty of them. They're everywhere.
